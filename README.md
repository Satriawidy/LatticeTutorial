# Basic Lattice Gauge Theory Computation

This is a repository to store codes on simple lattice gauge theory computation. The materials are based on the following [lecture notes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-lat/0506036). Some of the implementation are also inspired another works in [the following github page](https://github.com/AlessandroCotellucci/Lattice-QCD-for-novice), which also went through the lecture notes. More codes and improvement will be added in the future!
